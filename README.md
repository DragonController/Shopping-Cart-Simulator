**Shopping Cart Simulator**

This is a game created in Unity Version 2022.2.19f1. It allows players to act as a shopping cart and attempt to complete a shopping list within an allotted amount of time.

**Motivation:**

I wanted to make this project because I thought that it would be a fun twist on the Video Game Competition capstone project that many people would want to download and play.

**Tools Used:**

Unity
Visual Studio Code
Blender

**Assets Used:**

Atkinson Hyperlegible Font via the included SIL Open Font License

**How to Run:**

Unbuilt Version:
Open project via Unity Hub. Click on the play button.

Built Version (Windows):
Download the .zip file from https://www.dropbox.com/s/aexypga68grc76b/Build.zip?dl=0.
Extract the .zip file. Run ShoppingCartSimulator.exe.

**How to build (for Windows):**

Open project via the Unity Hub. Click File > Build Settings. Click Build.

**How to Play:**

Start by selecting the number of items that you want to collect and the mode that you want to play. The Tutorial mode has an unlimted amount of time, the Standard mode gives you two minutes to collect all of the items, and the Express mode gives you one minute to collect all of the items in time. The Tutorial mode also makes a window pop up when the game starts with extra instructions. Once you have selected the number of items and mode, click in the Place Order button. Once the game begins, try to collect all of the items on the list in the top right corner of your screen using your robotic arm and put them in your shopping cart's basket to collect them. When an item is detected as having been collected, it will be crossed off from the list. If you collect all of the items on the list in time, you win. If you run out of time, you lose.
